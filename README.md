## WALMART
#### To build a model which predict sales of the stores and calculate revenue to decide whether to make an investment or not by means of linear regression.



There are many seasons that sales are significantly higher or lower than averages. If the company does not know about these seasons, it can lose too much money. Predicting future sales is one of the most crucial plans for a company. Sales forecasting gives an idea to the company for arranging stocks, calculating revenue, and deciding to make a new investment. Another advantage of knowing future sales is that achieving predetermined targets from the beginning of the seasons can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions. Also, not reaching the projected target could significantly damage stock prices, conversely. And, it will be a big problem especially for Walmart as a big company.
